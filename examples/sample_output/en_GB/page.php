    'description' => 'Patlabor is an amazing series with excellent characters, plots which range from absurd comedies to political drama, wonderfully designed mecha, and a sense of realism which you don\'t find in most robot anime. It was often described by anime fans in the 1990\'s as the "Hill Street Blues" of anime, though the stories usually focus on the characters and not so much on the crime aspect. To me I think the series is more similar to British cop shows such as "The Last Detective" and "New Tricks", though with a much younger cast, more geared toward comedy and much less emphasis placed on police cases. Unlike most robot anime character development is the main focus of the series, rather than the robots being the focus as most robot anime tends to be. In fact some of the stories don\'t feature any robots at all.',
